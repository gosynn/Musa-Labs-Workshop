# 🔧 Windsurf Workflow Integration

### Suggested Windsurf Development Patterns

* **AI Scaffold Commands:**

  * “Generate module boilerplate for content ingestion service.”
  * “Create a reusable React Native vertical video player.”
  * “Generate CRUD endpoints for Series + Episodes.”

* **AI Code Review:**

  * Use Windsurf to auto-review pull requests for performance, security, and DRY principles.

* **AI Testing Generation:**

  * Automated Jest/Playwright test creation
  * Scenario-based load tests

* **AI Sprint Execution:**

  * Work in branches named:

    * `sprint-1-auth`
    * `sprint-2-player`
    * `sprint-3-personalization` etc.

# 🛠️ Resourcing Requirements

### Engineering

* **Backend:** API, DB, transcoding pipeline
* **Mobile:** React Native
* **ML:** Recommendations
* **QA:** Automated + manual cases
* **Design:** Figma screens, design system

### Infrastructure
